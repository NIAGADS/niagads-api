## NIAGADS Open Access: An Overview

The National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site -
[NIAGADS](https://www.niagads.org) - stores and distributes genetics and genomics data from studies on
Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD), related dementias (ADRD), and aging to qualified researchers globally.

[NIAGADS Open Access](https://www.niagads.org/open-access/) (NIAGADS-OA) is a collection of
files, curated annotations, and knowledgebases made available to the public with no data access restrictions.

## NIAGADS Open Access: API

The NIAGADS Open Access Application Programming Interface (NIAGADS-OA API) provides programmatic access to
Open Access data and annotations hosted at NIAGADS. It also makes NIAGADS knowledge base functionality
available for integration in analysis pipelines and web-front end toolkits.

This includes searching for, downloading, and interactively exploring data, metadata, and annotations
to facilitate both fine-mapping and investigations at chromosome- or genome-wide scales.

## NIAGADS Open Access: Knowledgebases

### GenomicsDB: Alzheimer's Genomics Database

The NIAGADS [Alzheimer's GenomicsDB](https://www.niagads.org/genomics) (GenomicsDB) is an
interactive knowledge base for AD genetics. It provides a platform for data sharing,
discovery, and exploration, including a custom genome-browser.

NIAGADS-OA API GenomicsDB endpoints allow users to discover, mine and browse annotated
AD/ADRD GWAS summary statistics datasets and Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP)
variants. Queries against the GenomicsDB can also compile these data in the context
of functionally annotated gene, variants, and genomic region records.

### FILER: Functional Genomics repository

The NIAGADS [FunctIonaL gEnomics Repository](https://tf.lisanwanglab.org/FILER/) (FILER)
is a comprehensive, harmonized, searchable human functional genomics data collection
compliled across >20 data sources.

NIAGADS-OA API FILER endpoints allow users to simultaneous search across >79k
functional genomics data tracks using both metadata and range searches.

### ADVP: Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal

The NIAGADS [Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal](https://advp.niagads.org/) (ADVP) is a
catalog of high-quality and suggestive genetic association findings curated from the literature.

NIAGADS-OA API ADVP endpoints allow users to search for reported gene- and variant-risk
associations by AD endophenotypes and neuropathologies across >80 cohorts and 8 populations.
