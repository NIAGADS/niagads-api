title: Getting Started with the NIAGADS-OA API
description: This guide explains how to construct and execute API requests and interpret responses.
---

The NIAGADS-OA API establishes a simple framework for sharing and integration of NIAGADS datasets
and annotated gene and variant records into analysis pipelines. Use of the API requires either a
(command line) tool or requests library that supports the HTTP protocol to transfer data,
permitting large-scale programmatic access independent of any specific platform or programming language.

## Tools and Libraries

Third-party tools can be used for communicating with the API and for exploring JSON responses. These include:

| **Tool**                                                      | **Type**                                     |

## API Endpoints

Communicating with the NIAGADS Open Access API involves making calls to API endpoints. Each endpoint
represents both the resource being queried and specific API functionality.

### Request URL

**The HTTP URL that corresponds to the latest version of an API endpoint
is:**<br/> `https://api.niagads.org/<resource>/<operation>`

In the request URL, `<resource>` is the name of the NIAGADS knowledge base and `<operation>` is
the type of request being made to the API.

<Note title="Other Versions">
    The HTTP URL of an endpoint corresponding to a specific major version of the
    API is `https://api.niagads.org/v<version>/<resource>/<operation>`,
    where `<version>` is the NIAGADS-OA API major version.
</Note>

### Resources

Allowable values for `<resource>` are summarized below:

| **Resource** | **Knoweldge Base**                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| genomics\*\* | GenomicsDB                              |
| filer        | FILER                                   |
| advp\*       | ADVP                                    |
| all\*        | search across all Open Access Resources |

\* coming soon<br/>
\*\* under construction

### Operations

Operations define particular functions or services provided by the API.  
Allowable values for `<operation>` are as follows:

| **Endpoint** | **Type**                  | **Description**                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| status       | Status                    | Get API status and versioning information                                    |
| record       | Data Retrieval            | Retrieve entity metadata, data, or annotations by ID                         |
| search       | Search                    | Find entities matching search criteria                                       |
| data         | Search and Data Retrieval | Retrieve data or annotations for one or more entity matching search criteria |
| service      | Data Retrieval            | Retrieve data specially formatted for NIAGADS visualization tools            |
| dictionary   | Search and Data Retrieval | Search or retrieve controlled vocabularies and ontologies                    |

### Entities

Some endpoints, such as `record` are further qualified by the entity type being queried. All
entities are assigned a unique identifier (ID). These are consistent across all NIAGADS Open Access
resources and are stored an entity's `id` property.

**The HTTP URL for retrieving the record for a specific entity is:** <br/>
`https://api.niagads.org/<resource>/record/<entity>/<id>`

The NIAGADS Open Access API supports queries for the following entities:

| **Entity** | **Record Type**                              | **Description**                           | **Identifier**                          | **Resource**   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| gene       | annotations, genetic associations            | Ensembl genes                             | Ensembl ID\*\*                          | genomics, advp |
| variant    | annotations, genetic associations            | SNVs, short INDELS, structural variants\* | chr:pos:ref:alt\*\* (SNV, short INDELs) | genomics, advp |
| span\*     | overlapping genomic features, data summaries | arbitrary genomic regions                 | chr:pos:start-end                       | genomics       |
| track      | metadata                                     | data tracks                               | genomics, filer                         |
| collection | metadata                                     | set of related data tracks                | genomics, filer                         |

\* coming soon <br/>
\*\* The NIAGADS-OA API will also accept industry standard alternative identifiers, such as refSNP ID for variants,
and Official gene symbols, Entrez Gene IDs, and UniProt identifiers for genes. However, these alternatives may not
uniquely, or unequivocally, map to NIAGADS OA entities.
