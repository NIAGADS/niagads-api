title: Getting Started with the NIAGADS-OA API
description: This guide explains how to construct and execute API requests and interpret responses.
---

The NIAGADS-OA API establishes a simple framework for sharing and integration of NIAGADS datasets
and annotated gene and variant records into analysis pipelines. Use of the API requires either a
(command line) tool or requests library that supports the HTTP protocol to transfer data,
permitting large-scale programmatic access independent of any specific platform or programming language.

## API Endpoints

Communicating with the NIAGADS Open Access API involves making calls to API endpoints. Each endpoint
represents both the resource being queried and specific API functionality.

### Request URL

**The HTTP URL that corresponds to the latest version of an API endpoint
is:**<br/> `https://api.niagads.org/<resource>/<operation>`

In the request URL, `<resource>` is the name of the NIAGADS knowledge base and `<operation>` is
the type of request being made to the API.

<Note title="Other Versions">
    The HTTP URL of an endpoint corresponding to a specific major version of the
    API is `https://api.niagads.org/v<version>/<resource>/<operation>`,
    whre `<version>` is the NIAGADS-OA API major version.
</Note>

### Resources

Allowable values for `<resource>` are summarized below:

| **Resource** | **Status**                                            | **Knoweldge Base**                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| genomics     | <span style={{color: "red"}}>under development</span> | GenomicsDB                              |
| filer        | <span style={{color: "green"}}>in production</span>   | FILER                                   |
| advp         | planned                                               | ADVP                                    |
| all          | planned                                               | search across all Open Access Resources |

### Operations

Operations define particular functions or services provided by the API.  
Allowable values for `<operation>` are as follows:

| **Operation** | **Type**                  | **Description**                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| status        | Status                    | Get API description and versioning information                               |
| record        | Entity Lookup             | Retrieve entity nomenclature, metadata, or annotations by ID                 |
| search        | Search                    | Find entities matching search criteria                                       |
| data          | Search and Data Retrieval | Retrieve data or annotations matching search criteria                        |
| service       | Data Retrieval            | Retrieve data formatted for input to NIAGADS visualization tools or services |
| dictionary    | Search and Data Retrieval | Search or retrieve controlled vocabularies and ontologies                    |

### Entities

`record` operations are further qualified by the `entity` type being queried.

All entities are assigned a unique **stable** identifier (ID). These are consistent across all NIAGADS Open Access
resources and are stored in a record's `id` property.

**The HTTP URL for retrieving the record for a specific entity is:** <br/>
`https://api.niagads.org/<resource>/record/<entity>/<id>`

The NIAGADS Open Access API supports queries for the following entities:

| **Entity** | **Record Contents**                          | **Description**           | **Identifier**                                                             | **Resource**    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| gene       | annotations, genetic associations            | Ensembl genes             | [Ensembl ID](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/genome/stable_ids/index.html) | genomics, advp  |
| variant    | annotations, genetic associations            | SNVs, short INDELS, SVs   | `chr:pos:ref:alt`, structural variant ID                                   | genomics, advp  |
| region     | overlapping genomic features, data summaries | arbitrary genomic regions | `chr:pos:start-end`                                                        | genomics        |
| track      | metadata                                     | data tracks               | `NG[unique alpha-numeric code]`                                            | genomics, filer |
| collection | metadata                                     | sets of related entities  | human-readable string                                                      | genomics, filer |

<Note title="Alternative Identifiers" type="danger">
	The NIAGADS-OA API will also accept industry standard alternative
	identifiers, such as refSNP ID for variants, and official symbols, and
	Entrez (NCBI Gene) IDs for genes. **However, these alternatives may not map
	unambiguously to NIAGADS-OA entities.**
</Note>

## Rate Limits

<Note title="Coming soon">
	More information about rate limits on API queries coming soon.
</Note>

## API Responses

The NIAGADS Open Access API uses JSON as its standard response format, although some endpoints can also return
plain text results (formatted as tab-delimited TEXT, YAML, BED, VCF) by setting a `format` parameter.

<Note title="Want XML?">
	Make a feature request on
	[GitHub](https://github.com/NIAGADS/niagads-api/discussions)!
</Note>

### JSON Response Format

The following fields are included in all successful, non-service API responses. Responses to `service` routes
will vary depending on their purpose.

<JsonSchema schema={"RecordResponse"} />

#### Data

Query results are found in the **data** field in the API response. It will always be an array;
even for single record lookups. However the schema for individual elements in the dataarray will vary depending
on the entity or data type being queried.

<Note title="More information about types of data responses coming soon">
	Full JSON schemas are availble in the [Open API
	documentation](https://api.niagads.org/redoc).
</Note>

#### Request

The **request** field in the response lists the details of the user request.

<JsonSchema schema={"RequestDataModel"} />

#### Pagination

Many NIAGADS-OA API queries can return large quantities of structured data, all results are paged, with
a maximum of **5000** data points returned per page. The **pagination** field returns the details of the
result size and current page.

<JsonSchema schema={"PaginationDataModel"} />

### Status Codes

API responses include a HTTP status code indicating whether the request was successfully completed.

| **Status Code**               | **Type**     | **Description**                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **200 OK**                    | Success      | successful response                                                |
| **404 Not Found**             | Client Error | record not found                                                   |
| **422 Unprocessable Content** | Client Error | parameter validation error                                         |
| **429 Too Many Requests**     | Client Error | too many requests in a given amount of time, exceeding rate limits |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | Server Error | runtime error generating a request response                        |
| **503 Service Unavailable**   | Server Error | system or database error                                           |
